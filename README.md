## The course
Computational Musicology can be described as any use of computers as a fundamental tool for answering musicological questions. For this course I made an online storyboard that takes a deeper dive into which elements make music a winter or a summer song and tried to use Artificial Intelligence to predict whether a specific song fits more in a summer or a winter playlist. This was coded in R and the data was scraped using the Spotify Developer API. 

The ``index.Rmd`` file contains the R markdown code used to scrape the data and perform the analyses, where ``index.html`` contains the code for the storyboard layout. The final two files ``clustering2.py`` and ``music_data.csv`` contain the data and code for the machine learning aspect of this assignment.
